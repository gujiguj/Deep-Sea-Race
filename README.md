A race simulation of sea creatures.  
Made by [Lucy Wang](https://github.com/gujiguj) and [Audrey Yang](https://github.com/audrey-yang) for HackItShipIt Hackathon  
July 2020

## What This Is
This app introduces the user to a few ocean creatures, giving them information about each of the animals and allowing them run a simulation of how fast the animals would move.  
Disclaimer: Animal graphics are not to scale.

## How We Made It
We used Java's Swing Library to create a GUI. The animals are animated using two frames each.

## How to Run
Clone [this repository](https://github.com/gujiguj/Deep-Sea-Race) and run the main method in the Main class.
